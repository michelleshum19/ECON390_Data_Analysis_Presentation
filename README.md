# ECON 390 Final Project: Housing Investment Profitability
Final Grade: 80%

## Overview
This project analyzes whether purchasing a home for the purposes of renting out is generally profitable. By performing a regression analysis on variables such as mortgage rates, median house price, and rent yield, we explore how these factors influence the number of units sold.

## Key Findings
- Rental prices and median house prices are significant predictors of the number of units sold.
- Mortgage rates do not appear to be a significant predictor in this model.
- Based on our analysis, it is not profitable to purchase a home solely for the purpose of renting it out as an investment.

## Data
The following variables were used in the regression analysis:
- **Y variable**: Number of units sold
- **X variables**: Mortgage rate, median house price, rent yield

## Conclusion
The regression analysis suggests that while rental prices and house prices are crucial factors, mortgage rates are not. The model ultimately concludes that purchasing a home for renting as an investment is not profitable.
